VCFX_phred_filter: Filter VCF lines by their QUAL field.

Usage:
  VCFX_phred_filter [options] [files...]
  VCFX_phred_filter [options] < input.vcf > output.vcf

Options:
  -p, --phred-filter <VAL>      Phred QUAL threshold (default=30)
  -k, --keep-missing-qual       Treat '.' (missing QUAL) as pass
  -h, --help                    Display this help and exit

Description:
  Reads VCF lines from files or stdin. For each data line, parse the QUAL field.
  If QUAL >= threshold => print line. Otherwise, skip. By default, missing
  QUAL ('.') is treated as 0. Use --keep-missing-qual to treat '.' as pass.

  When file arguments are provided, uses memory-mapped I/O for faster
  processing of large files.

Examples:
  1) Keep variants with QUAL>=30 (from file):
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 30 input.vcf > out.vcf
  2) Keep variants with QUAL>=30 (from stdin):
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 30 < in.vcf > out.vcf
  3) Keep missing QUAL lines:
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 30 --keep-missing-qual input.vcf > out.vcf
  4) Process multiple files:
     VCFX_phred_filter -p 20 file1.vcf file2.vcf > combined.vcf
