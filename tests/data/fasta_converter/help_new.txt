VCFX_fasta_converter: Convert VCF to per-sample FASTA.

Usage: VCFX_fasta_converter [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Options:
  -i, --input FILE    Input VCF file (fastest with mmap)
  -q, --quiet         Suppress warnings
  -h, --help          Show this help

Algorithm: Two-pass with contiguous memory buffer.
  Pass 1: Count variants (fast scan)
  Pass 2: Parse genotypes into pre-allocated buffer
  Output: Sequential memory access, perfect cache locality

Memory: O(variants × samples) - pre-allocated, no reallocations
Speed: ~200 MB/s VCF throughput on modern hardware
