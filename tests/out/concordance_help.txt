VCFX_cross_sample_concordance: Check variant concordance across multiple samples.

Usage:
  VCFX_cross_sample_concordance [options] < input.vcf > concordance_results.txt
  VCFX_cross_sample_concordance -i input.vcf > concordance_results.txt

Options:
  -i, --input FILE        Input VCF file (uses mmap for best performance)
  -s, --samples LIST      Comma-separated list of samples to check
  -t, --threads N         Number of processing threads (default: auto)
  -q, --quiet             Suppress summary statistics to stderr
  -h, --help              Display this help message and exit

Description:
  Reads a multi-sample VCF, normalizes each sample's genotype
  (including multi-allelic variants), and determines if all samples that
  have a parseable genotype are in complete agreement.

Performance:
  Uses multi-threaded parallel processing with memory-mapped I/O
  and early-termination optimization for extreme performance.

Example:
  VCFX_cross_sample_concordance -i input.vcf -t 8 > results.tsv
