VCFX_phase_checker: Output only VCF variant lines in which every sample genotype is fully phased.

Usage:
  VCFX_phase_checker [options] [input.vcf]
  VCFX_phase_checker [options] < input.vcf > phased_output.vcf

Options:
  -h, --help          Display this help message and exit
  -i, --input FILE    Input VCF file (uses fast memory-mapped I/O)
  -q, --quiet         Suppress warning messages to stderr

Description:
  The tool reads a VCF and checks the GT field (genotype) for each sample.
  A genotype is considered fully phased if it uses the '|' separator (e.g., "0|1")
  and contains no missing alleles. If every sample in a variant line is fully phased,
  the line is printed to stdout; otherwise, it is skipped with a warning to stderr.

Performance:
  File input (-i) uses memory-mapped I/O for 10-12x faster processing compared to stdin.
  Features include:
  - SIMD-optimized line scanning (AVX2/SSE2 on x86_64)
  - Zero-copy string parsing with string_view
  - 1MB output buffering
  - FORMAT field caching (GT index computed once per unique FORMAT)
  - Early termination on first unphased sample

Examples:
  VCFX_phase_checker -i input.vcf > phased.vcf       # Fast (mmap)
  VCFX_phase_checker input.vcf > phased.vcf          # Fast (mmap)
  VCFX_phase_checker < input.vcf > phased.vcf        # Slower (stdin)
  VCFX_phase_checker -q -i input.vcf > phased.vcf    # Quiet mode (no warnings)
