## Publication Information

The VCFX toolkit was presented at the 12th International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering (IWBBIO 2025), held in Gran Canaria, Spain, from July 16-18, 2025.

### Abstract

VCFX is a collection of specialized C/C++ command-line tools designed for efficient manipulation, analysis, and transformation of VCF (Variant Call Format) files used in genomic research and bioinformatics. Each tool is an independent executable that follows the Unix philosophy: do one thing well and work seamlessly with other tools through standard input/output streams. The toolkit includes 60 specialized utilities covering the entire lifecycle of variant data analysis from filtering and annotation to merging, phasing, and structural variant manipulation.
