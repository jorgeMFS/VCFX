# VCFX_missing_detector

## Overview

VCFX_missing_detector identifies and flags variants in a VCF file that contain missing genotype data in any sample. This tool helps researchers identify potentially problematic variants or samples with incomplete data that may require special handling in downstream analyses.

## Usage

```bash
VCFX_missing_detector [OPTIONS] < input.vcf > flagged.vcf
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h`, `--help` | Display help message and exit |

## Description

VCFX_missing_detector analyzes a VCF file to identify variants with missing genotype data. The tool:

1. Reads a VCF file from standard input line by line
2. For each variant, examines the genotype (GT) field of all samples
3. Identifies missing genotypes where:
   - The entire genotype is missing (e.g., `./.`, `.|.`, or `.`)
   - Either allele in a diploid genotype is missing (e.g., `./0`, `1/.`)
4. Adds a flag `MISSING_GENOTYPES=1` to the INFO field of variants with any missing data
5. Writes the processed VCF to standard output

This simple annotation allows researchers to easily:
- Filter variants based on missing data presence using standard VCF tools
- Identify data completeness issues that might affect analysis results
- Implement different handling strategies for variants with missing data

## Output Format

The output is a valid VCF file with the same format as the input, but with an additional INFO field annotation for variants containing missing genotypes:

```
MISSING_GENOTYPES=1
```

This annotation is appended to the existing INFO field, or replaces the `.` placeholder if the INFO field is empty.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Flag variants with missing genotypes
./VCFX_missing_detector < input.vcf > flagged.vcf
```

### In a Pipeline with Filtering

```bash
# Flag variants with missing genotypes, then filter to keep only complete variants
./VCFX_missing_detector < input.vcf | grep -v "MISSING_GENOTYPES=1" > complete_variants.vcf
```

### Counting Missing Variants

```bash
# Count variants with missing genotypes
./VCFX_missing_detector < input.vcf | grep "MISSING_GENOTYPES=1" | wc -l
```

### Counting All Variants Before Summary

```bash
# Count total variants and those with missing data
./VCFX_missing_detector < input.vcf > flagged.vcf
echo "Total variants: $(grep -v "^#" flagged.vcf | wc -l)"
echo "Variants with missing data: $(grep "MISSING_GENOTYPES=1" flagged.vcf | wc -l)"
```

## Missing Genotype Detection

The tool uses comprehensive logic to identify various forms of missing genotype data:

1. **Completely missing genotypes**: Formats like `./.`, `.|.`, or just `.`
2. **Partially missing diploid genotypes**: When one allele is missing, like `./1` or `0/.`
3. **Multi-field format handling**: Properly extracts just the GT portion when other fields (like DP, GQ) are present
4. **Format field awareness**: Correctly identifies the GT position in the FORMAT string

The tool examines each sample column independently and flags a variant if any sample has missing data.

## Handling Special Cases

The tool implements several strategies for handling edge cases:

1. **Missing FORMAT field**: If GT is not included in the FORMAT column, the variant is passed through unchanged
2. **No sample columns**: Variants with fewer than 9 columns are passed through unchanged
3. **Empty INFO field**: If the original INFO is "." (missing), it's replaced with "MISSING_GENOTYPES=1"
4. **Non-empty INFO field**: The missing flag is appended with a semicolon separator
5. **Empty lines**: Preserved with a single newline
6. **Header lines**: Passed through unchanged
7. **Non-diploid genotypes**: The tool focuses on diploid genotypes with a single delimiter ('/' or '|')

## Performance

VCFX_missing_detector is designed for efficiency:

1. Single-pass processing with O(n) time complexity where n is the number of variants
2. Minimal memory usage, with no requirement to load the entire file
3. String operations optimized for performance
4. Line-by-line processing enabling streaming workflow
5. Disk I/O limited only to reading input and writing output

## Limitations

1. Primarily designed for diploid genotypes; may not correctly identify missing data in haploid or polyploid contexts
2. Limited to checking the GT field; does not evaluate other potential indicators of missing data
3. No built-in functionality to annotate the percentage or count of samples with missing data
4. No option to customize the INFO field tag name from the default "MISSING_GENOTYPES"
5. Cannot perform sample-specific missing data analysis, such as identifying which samples contribute most to missingness
6. No threshold options (e.g., flag only if more than X% of samples have missing data)
7. Limited to binary detection (missing/not missing) without quantifying the degree of missingness
