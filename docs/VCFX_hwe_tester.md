# VCFX_hwe_tester

## Overview

VCFX_hwe_tester performs Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) testing on biallelic variants in a VCF file, calculating and reporting exact p-values that measure the degree of deviation from expected genotype frequencies.

## Usage

```bash
VCFX_hwe_tester [OPTIONS] < input.vcf > hwe_results.txt
```

## Description

VCFX_hwe_tester analyzes each biallelic variant in a VCF file to determine whether its genotype frequencies conform to Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectations. The tool:

1. Reads the VCF file line by line
2. Filters for biallelic variants (skips sites with multiple ALT alleles)
3. Counts homozygous reference (0/0), heterozygous (0/1), and homozygous alternate (1/1) genotypes
4. Calculates an exact p-value for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
5. Reports results in a simple tab-delimited format

The exact test uses a full enumeration of the probability distribution to obtain an accurate p-value, rather than relying on chi-square approximations. A low p-value indicates significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, which might suggest:
- Population stratification
- Selection pressure
- Non-random mating
- Genotyping errors

## Output Format

The output is a tab-delimited text file with the following columns:

```
CHROM  POS  ID  REF  ALT  HWE_pvalue
```

Where:
- CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT are copied from the input VCF
- HWE_pvalue is the calculated p-value for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
./VCFX_hwe_tester < input.vcf > hwe_results.txt
```

### Filter by HWE p-value

```bash
# Extract variants with significant HWE deviation (p < 0.05)
./VCFX_hwe_tester < input.vcf | awk -F'\t' '{if(NR==1 || ($6!="HWE_pvalue" && $6<0.05)) print}' > hwe_significant.txt
```

### Check for Genotyping Errors

```bash
# Find potential genotyping errors (extremely low HWE p-values)
./VCFX_hwe_tester < input.vcf | awk -F'\t' '{if(NR==1 || ($6!="HWE_pvalue" && $6<0.0001)) print}' > potential_errors.txt
```

## Mathematical Details

The tool uses an exact test based on the multinomial distribution of genotypes. For each variant:

1. The observed counts of genotypes (homRef, het, homAlt) are calculated
2. The expected frequencies under HWE are computed as:
   - Expected homRef = p² × N
   - Expected het = 2pq × N
   - Expected homAlt = q² × N
   
   where p = (2×homRef + het)/(2×N), q = 1-p, and N = total number of individuals

3. The p-value is calculated by summing the probabilities of all possible genotype configurations that are equally or less likely than the observed configuration

This approach provides accurate p-values even for low minor allele frequencies or small sample sizes.

## Handling Special Cases

- **Multi-allelic variants**: Skipped entirely (only biallelic variants are considered)
- **Missing genotypes**: Excluded from counts when calculating HWE
- **Phased genotypes**: Phase information is ignored; "0|1" is treated the same as "0/1"
- **Non-standard genotypes**: Any genotype other than 0/0, 0/1, or 1/1 is excluded
- **No valid genotypes**: If no valid genotypes are found, the p-value is reported as 1.0
- **Perfect equilibrium**: For variants with genotype frequencies perfectly matching HWE expectations, the p-value is 1.0

## Performance

The tool is optimized for efficiency:
- Processes one variant at a time, keeping memory usage low
- Caches logarithmic factorial values to speed up calculations
- Uses numerical optimizations to handle large sample sizes
- Scales linearly with the number of variants in the VCF file

## Limitations

- Only works with biallelic variants
- Assumes diploid genotypes
- No stratification by population or other groupings
- No correction for multiple testing
- May be less accurate for extremely rare variants with very few non-reference genotypes
- No built-in filtering for variant quality or missing data threshold
