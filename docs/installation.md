# Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install the VCFX toolkit on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before installing VCFX, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
- Python 3.10+ (for PyPI installation)
- C++ compiler (GCC 5.0+ or Clang 3.8+) - only for building from source
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher) - only for building from source

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using PyPI (Python Package Index)

The simplest way to install VCFX with Python bindings:

```bash
pip install vcfx
```

This installs the Python package with bindings to the C++ library. To use the command-line tools, you'll also need to install them separately via one of the other methods below.

For development or to install directly from the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX.git
cd VCFX
pip install -e ./python
```

### Method 2: Using Bioconda

VCFX is available in the Bioconda channel, providing both the command-line tools and Python bindings:

```bash
# Set up Bioconda channels if you haven't already
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Install VCFX
conda install vcfx
```

This method automatically handles all dependencies and provides a ready-to-use installation of VCFX with all command-line tools.

### Method 3: Using Docker

The simplest way to use VCFX is with Docker, which requires no compilation:

```bash
# Pull the VCFX Docker image (only needed once)
docker pull ghcr.io/jorgemfs/vcfx:latest

# Run a VCFX tool
docker run --rm ghcr.io/jorgemfs/vcfx:latest VCFX_tool_name [options]

# Process files by mounting a directory with your data
docker run --rm -v /path/to/your/data:/data ghcr.io/jorgemfs/vcfx:latest 'cat /data/input.vcf | VCFX_tool_name > /data/output.tsv'
```

This method is ideal for:
- Quick testing without installing anything locally
- Running VCFX in any environment with Docker
- Ensuring consistent tool behavior across different systems

For more advanced Docker usage, see the [Docker Guide](docker.md).

### Method 4: Building from Source

This method ensures you have the latest version of VCFX.

1. Clone the VCFX repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX.git
   cd VCFX
   ```

2. Create a build directory and build the tools:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. (Optional) Install the tools:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   By default the tools are installed into `~/.local`, so no administrator
   privileges are required. You can change the destination with
   `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/path ..` if desired.

After installation, you should be able to run VCFX tools from your terminal.

### Method 5: Building with Python Bindings

To build VCFX with Python bindings from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX.git
cd VCFX
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..
make
```

Then install the Python package:
```bash
cd ../python
pip install .
```

This gives you both the command-line tools and the Python API.

### Method 6: Building Individual Tools

If you only need specific tools, you can build them individually:

```bash
cd VCFX/build
make VCFX_tool_name
```

Replace `VCFX_tool_name` with the actual tool name (e.g., `VCFX_allele_freq_calc`).

### Method 7: Building Your Own Docker Image

If you need to customize the Docker image, you can build it yourself:

1. Clone the VCFX repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX.git
   cd VCFX
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t vcfx:local .
   ```

   Or use docker-compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Run a VCFX tool:

   ```bash
   # Using docker directly
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/data vcfx:local VCFX_tool_name [options]
   
   # Using docker-compose
   docker-compose run --rm vcfx VCFX_tool_name [options]
   ```

## Verifying Installation

To verify that VCFX tools are installed correctly, you can run:

```bash
VCFX_validator --help
```

You should see the help message for the VCFX_validator tool.

## Adding VCFX to Your PATH

If you didn't use `make install` or want to run tools directly from the build directory, you can add them to your PATH:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/VCFX/build/src"
```

Replace `/path/to/VCFX` with the absolute path to your VCFX repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies

If CMake complains about missing dependencies, you may need to install additional libraries:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cmake
```

### Compilation Errors

If you encounter compilation errors, ensure you're using a compatible compiler version and have all necessary dependencies installed.

### Path Issues

If you get "command not found" errors when trying to run VCFX tools, check that:

1. The tools were built successfully
2. The tools are in your PATH
3. The executable files have execute permissions

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during installation, please:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX/issues) to see if your problem has been reported
2. Open a new issue if necessary, including details about your system and the exact error messages
