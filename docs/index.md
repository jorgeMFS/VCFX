# VCFX: A Comprehensive VCF Manipulation Toolkit

VCFX is a collection of specialized command-line tools designed for efficient manipulation, analysis, and transformation of VCF (Variant Call Format) files used in genomic research and bioinformatics. Available via PyPI, Bioconda, and Docker.

## What is VCFX?

VCFX follows the Unix philosophy of creating small, focused tools that do one thing well and can be combined together to form powerful workflows. Each tool in the VCFX suite is optimized for a specific VCF-related task, with optional Python bindings for programmatic access.

Key features:
- 60+ specialized command-line tools
- Python API with structured data types
- Easy installation via `pip install vcfx`
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS)
- Composable tools for pipeline integration

VCFX enables researchers and bioinformaticians to:

- Extract specific information from VCF files
- Filter variants based on various criteria
- Transform VCF data into different formats
- Analyze genotypes and compute statistics
- Validate and check VCF file integrity
- Manipulate structural variants and complex records

## Getting Started

To begin using VCFX, first follow the [installation instructions](#installation) below, then explore the [tool categories](#tool-categories) to find the right components for your workflow.

### Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### PyPI (Python users)
```bash
pip install vcfx
```

#### Bioconda (includes all tools)
```bash
conda install -c bioconda vcfx
```

#### Build from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ieeta-pt/VCFX.git
cd VCFX
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON ..
make
```

See the [full installation guide](installation.md) for more options including Docker.

### Basic Example

Here's a simple example of using VCFX to analyze variants:

```bash
# Command line usage
cat input.vcf | \
  VCFX_variant_classifier --append-info | \
  grep 'VCF_CLASS=SNP' | \
  VCFX_allele_freq_calc > snp_frequencies.tsv
```

```python
# Python API usage
import vcfx

# Count variants
count = vcfx.variant_counter("input.vcf")

# Calculate allele frequencies with structured output
freqs = vcfx.allele_freq_calc("input.vcf")
for f in freqs:
    print(f"Position {f.Pos}: AF={f.Allele_Frequency}")
```

## Python API

VCFX provides comprehensive Python bindings that wrap all command-line tools and provide additional conveniences:

- **Structured data types**: Tool outputs are parsed into dataclasses with proper typing
- **Easy integration**: All tools accessible via `vcfx.tool_name()` functions
- **Error handling**: Clear exceptions when tools fail
- **Helper functions**: Utilities for reading compressed files, text processing, etc.

Example:
```python
import vcfx

# Tools return structured data, not just strings
results = vcfx.hwe_tester("variants.vcf")
for variant in results:
    if variant.HWE_pvalue < 0.05:
        print(f"Variant at {variant.Pos} deviates from HWE (p={variant.HWE_pvalue})")
```

See the [Python API documentation](python_api.md) for complete details.
